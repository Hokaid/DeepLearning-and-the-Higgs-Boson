https://www.kaggle.com/datatheque/association-rules-mining-market-basket-analysis/notebook

You can find the data used for this on the **Input (1)** section on the right
side.

Replicate the experiment on a Colab Notebook.

* (3 points) Make data accessible and load it on your notebook
* (2 points) Implement the code the author of the post gave us.
* (3 points) Make it work correctly.
* (4 points) Explain what she is doing and why.
* (4 points) Is it possible to mine emerging patterns? If so explain how or
             add code to make it so.
* (4 points) Is is possible to mine sky patterns? If so explain how or add code
             to make it so.
